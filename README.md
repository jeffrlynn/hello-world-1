Descrption of self:

Married, 2 cats

Graduated from UIUC in 2012 with a BS in Integrative Biology. Spent the following summer interning with Dupont Pioneer, conducting soybean product development research. Found work "in my field" as a QA technician at a small lab in Chicago. Moved out of the city and transitioned to specialty gas production - a very strange business. Company moved to Indianapolis and I became Senior Technician/ Lab Manager. Started learning to code in an effort to gain useful skills and change career.

Love hiking, rock climbing, biking, camping, but don't get outside enough because I also love pc gaming and breweries. I collect hobbies.
